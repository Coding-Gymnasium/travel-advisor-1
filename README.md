# Travel Advisor Tutorial app by JSMastery

## Summary

Completed this tutorial slowly to really let the concepts sink in and to allow myself to explore and try things out.
Along the way I ran into a few problems that I had to debug on my own. This was a great opportunity to dig deeper and learn more about hooks and scope, as well as how to use the dev tools better.
Overall a really fun tutorial
